# Approximate Riemann solvers as building blocks

A capturing scheme evaluates $\hat f(u^-_{i+1/2}, u^+_{i+1/2})$ at each
interface. At first order this is a [monotone flux](/definitions/monotone-flux.md)
or an E-flux; at high order its choice still sets contact and shear
resolution and robustness. Finite-volume WENO and
[AFD-WENO](/methods/alternative-finite-difference-weno.md) accept any
solver. Classical FD-WENO needs a smooth flux splitting and so is
restricted to Lax–Friedrichs or Roe-type fluxes
([Balsara et al. (2025)](/sources/balsara-2025.md), §I).

* **Lax–Friedrichs / Rusanov / LLF**: centred average plus dissipation
  $\alpha$. It is robust and positivity-preserving for Euler under
  $\nu \le 1$ ([positivity preservation](/properties/positivity-preserving.md)),
  but it does not open the Riemann fan, so contacts smear.
  Titarev and Toro's WENO-HLLC and WENO-MUSTA are about twice as
  accurate on the same mesh as the Rusanov-based FV-WENO of Shi, Hu and
  Shu ([Titarev & Toro (2004)](/sources/titarev-2004.md), §5.1–5.2).
* **HLLC** (Toro, Spruce & Speares): a three-wave model with speeds
  $S_L \le S_M \le S_R$ and two star states. It contains all waves of the
  Euler Riemann fan, uses no linearization, and works for low density
  and sonic points without fixes ([Titarev & Toro (2004)](/sources/titarev-2004.md), §4.1).
  With the wave speeds of Batten et al. it resolves isolated shocks and
  contacts exactly. The star states stay in $\mathcal{G}$, so the
  first-order scheme is positivity-preserving under
  $\Delta t\,\Vert\vert u\vert + c\Vert_\infty/h \le 1$
  ([Guo, Xiong & Shi (2014)](/sources/guo-2014.md), §2.4, Remark 1). Being
  less dissipative, it can leave oscillations in velocity and internal
  energy near vacuum, where Lax–Friedrichs is cleaner (Examples 6, 8).
* **MUSTA** (Toro): opens the Riemann fan numerically by evolving the
  two-cell data with a first-order predictor flux — FORCE, whose
  viscosity is half the Lax–Friedrichs one — for $k$ stages
  ($k = 2$–$3$ approaches the exact Godunov flux; $k = 2$ is used). It
  needs no eigenstructure, so it suits systems whose characteristic
  information is unknown, at a cost comparable to approximate Riemann
  solvers. HLLC resolves slip lines better than MUSTA in the
  [double Mach reflection](/benchmarks/double-mach-reflection.md)
  ([Titarev & Toro (2004)](/sources/titarev-2004.md), §§4.2, 5.3).
* **Roe** for MHD shock tubes and **HLLC** for Euler in GP-WENO
  ([Reyes et al. (2018)](/sources/reyes-2018.md), §5).
* **HLLI / LLFI** (Dumbser–Balsara): HLL-type solvers that resolve
  intermediate (linearly degenerate) waves, used throughout AFD-WENO.
  A solver that keeps stationary contacts makes the whole AFD scheme do
  so, which helps well-balancing ([Balsara et al. (2025)](/sources/balsara-2025.md), §II).
* **Multidimensional HLL / LLF** solvers at mesh edges, for the
  electric field of the induction equation; they reduce to the 1D
  solver for one-dimensional variation
  ([constrained transport](/methods/constrained-transport.md);
  [Balsara, Bhoriya & Shu (2026)](/sources/balsara-2026.md), §3).

In 3D FV-WENO the flux integral over a face is approximated by a tensor
Gauss rule, so a Riemann solve is needed at each face Gauss point
([finite-volume reconstruction](/methods/finite-volume-reconstruction.md);
[Titarev & Toro (2004)](/sources/titarev-2004.md), §2).
